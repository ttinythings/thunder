ReasonML/OCaml ecosystem is great in many aspects but we don't have quality, go-to solutions enough to attract people from other disciplines. Yes, there are a bunch of Bucklescript bindings that provide some solutions but most of them are incomplete, unstable or not even usable. If we want to push ReasonML and make it a mainstream language, we have to provide simple, powerful, well-documented libraries/frameworks and tools. Not just Bucklescript bindings.

People wanna love this language and ecosystem but they encounter a lot of hassle. There are solutions but all over the place. Especially as a newcomer, you should search and read a lot to understand what is going on and what you should use. That's so much effort for the people who just want to try things out. We can't keep them in the Reason circle with this way. We should provide happy paths to the people and make them focus on their products.

Within this vision, `Thunder` aims to turn backend development to a breeze. We will try to provide the simplest solutions as much as we can to help you to just think about your application, not the technology you use. You will be able to write your own API within minutes if not in seconds ðŸš€

# All-in-one ðŸ“¦
`Thunder` will provide whatever the community needs. Unfortunately, we are even far away from a "stable web framework" and our main focus is this. But we know that, `Thunder` wouldn't mean so much without a decent ORM, validation library, JSON, JS Promise solution, etc. We will pack the simplest and powerful solutions from the community or we will develop our solutions to help you.
